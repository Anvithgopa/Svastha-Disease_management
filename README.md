DISEASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - DBMS Project

**Introduction to Database Management System**
A database management system (DBMS) refers to the technology for creating and managing
databases. DBMS is a software tool to organize (create, retrieve, update, and manage) data in
a database. A software for storing and retrieving user by considering appropriate security
measures. It allows users to create their own databases as per their requirement.

It consists of group of programs which manipulate the database and provide an interface
between the database. It includes the user of the database and other application programs. The
DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to
provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party
software to store and retrieve data.

If it is any field that has contributed to the greatest advancements in the world today, it is the
field of information technology, commonly known by the acronym IT. When most people
hear of the phrase ‘information technology’, they tend to picture several Tecno-geeks seated
by the computer and fixing some computer software.

**Introduction to MySQL**
MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (“RDBMS”). It is used by most
modern websites and web-based services as a convenient and fast-access storage and retrieval
solution for large volumes of data. MySQL is open-source and free software under the GNU
license. It is supported by Oracle Company.
It is developed, marketed, and supported by MySQL AB, a Swedish company, and written
in C programming language and C++ programming language. MySQL supports many
Operating Systems like Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc. with C, C++, and Java languages.
MySQL can also be accessed using many tools. It can be easily communicated with via PHP
(PHP Hypertext Preprocessor), a scripting language whose primary focus is to manipulate

HTML for a webpage on the server before it is delivered to a client’s machine. A user can
submit queries to a database via PHP, allowing insertion, retrieval and manipulation of
information into/from the database.

MySQL server design is multi-layered with independent modules and is fully multithreaded
by using kernel threads. It can handle multiple CPUs if they are available. MySQL Server
works in client/server or embedded systems. and it works on many different platforms.
