DISEASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - DBMS Project

**Introduction to Database Management System**

A database management system (DBMS) refers to the technology for creating and managing
databases. DBMS is a software tool to organize (create, retrieve, update, and manage) data in
a database. A software for storing and retrieving user by considering appropriate security
measures. It allows users to create their own databases as per their requirement.

It consists of group of programs which manipulate the database and provide an interface
between the database. It includes the user of the database and other application programs. The
DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to
provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party
software to store and retrieve data.

If it is any field that has contributed to the greatest advancements in the world today, it is the
field of information technology, commonly known by the acronym IT. When most people
hear of the phrase ‘information technology’, they tend to picture several Tecno-geeks seated
by the computer and fixing some computer software.

**Introduction to MySQL**

MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (“RDBMS”). It is used by most
modern websites and web-based services as a convenient and fast-access storage and retrieval
solution for large volumes of data. MySQL is open-source and free software under the GNU
license. It is supported by Oracle Company.
It is developed, marketed, and supported by MySQL AB, a Swedish company, and written
in C programming language and C++ programming language. MySQL supports many
Operating Systems like Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc. with C, C++, and Java languages.
MySQL can also be accessed using many tools. It can be easily communicated with via PHP
(PHP Hypertext Preprocessor), a scripting language whose primary focus is to manipulate

HTML for a webpage on the server before it is delivered to a client’s machine. A user can
submit queries to a database via PHP, allowing insertion, retrieval and manipulation of
information into/from the database.

MySQL server design is multi-layered with independent modules and is fully multithreaded
by using kernel threads. It can handle multiple CPUs if they are available. MySQL Server
works in client/server or embedded systems. and it works on many different platforms.

**Purpose of this project**

The main purpose of the Disease management system is to manage the details of diseases
that has spread in a particular locality. The project is totally built at administrative end and
thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access. The purpose of the project is to build an
application program to reduce the manual work for managing the details of diseases in a
muncipality.

Our software eliminate coupons and human error in accounting. Diseases details are collected
from various hospitals in the locality in order to make a detailed analysis. It helps the officials
in the muncipality to analyse the health situation of the town. Common people are also
allowed to use this application program inorder to make a personal analysis. It tracks all the
details about the hospitals in the town and declares weather the disease is vulnerable or not.

The proposed system has the following requirements:
• System needs store information about new entry of patients in the hospitals.
• System needs to help the internal staff to keep information of diseases and find their
causes and symptoms and mode of spreading as per various queries.
• System need to update and delete the record.
• It satisfy the user requirement.
• Be easy to understand by the user and operator.
• Have a good user interface.
• Deliver accurate data.

**Software requirements**

• OS: Windows 10/11
• Any text editor
• Xampp
• Front-end: HTML, CSS
• Back-end: PHP,Mysql

**Hardware requirements**

• Hardware Disk Capacity: 256GB or Above
• RAM: 2 GB or Above

**Conclusion**

Our project is only a humble venture to satisfy the needs to manage their work. Several user friendly coding have also adopted. This package shall prove to be a powerful package in satisfying all the requirements of the Disease Management System.

The objective of the software planning  is to provide a frame work that enables the manager to make reasonable estimates made within a limited time frame at the beginning of the software project and should be updated regularly as the project progresses.  We define the problem on which we are working in the project. We describe the requirement specifications of the system and the actions that can be done on these things.

We understand the problem domain and produce a model of the system, which describes operations that can be performed on the system. We included features and operations in detail. We designed user interface and security issues related to system. Finally the system is implemented and tested according to test cases.
